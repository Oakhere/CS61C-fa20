1. While you’re in a gdb session, how do you set the arguments that will be passed to the program when it’s run? 
r <args>

2. How do you create a breakpoint?
b main (create a breakpoint at main function)
b --name <function_name> (create a breakpoint at a specific function)
b --line <line_number> (create a breakpoint at a specific line)

3. How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
n (or next)

4. If the next line of code is a function call, you’ll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function (i.e. step into the function) instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
s (or step)

5. How do you continue the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
continue

6. How can you print the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
p <variable_name>

7. How do you configure gdb so it displays the value of a variable after every step?
set target.process.thread.trace-thread true

8. How do you show a list of all local variables and their values in the current function?
fr v

9. How do you quit out of gdb?
quit
